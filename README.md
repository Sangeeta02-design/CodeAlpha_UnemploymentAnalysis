## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes:
- 📅 **Temporal Trends**: National unemployment fluctuations across time (monthly and yearly)
- 🗺️ **State-Level Patterns**: States most and least affected by unemployment
- 🧭 **COVID-19 Impact**: Comparison of unemployment **Before**, **During**, and **After** the pandemic
- 🌇 **Urban vs Rural Areas**: Understanding unemployment variation across areas
- 🔁 **Seasonal Trends**: Monthly patterns using heatmaps to identify high/low unemployment seasons

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- `pandas`, `numpy` – data processing
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization
- `scikit-learn` – basic modeling (optional)
- `datetime` – date manipulation

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- 📉 Line chart: National unemployment rate over time
- 🔥 Heatmap: Monthly unemployment distribution across years
- 🧮 Boxplots: Compare Pre/During/Post COVID periods
- 🗺️ Bar charts: State-wise average unemployment
- 🏙️ Area-based: Urban vs Rural unemployment patterns

## 🧠 Insights & Interpretation

- COVID-19 (March 2020 – Dec 2021) led to a sharp increase in unemployment across most Indian states.
- Urban areas were more volatile in terms of job losses compared to rural regions.
